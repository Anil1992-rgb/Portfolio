            <img src="assets/images/me.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="ME!" height="200px" />

            <p> Currently attending University of Oregon coding bootcamp to gain skills and knowledge to become a full
                stack developer.
                I want to become a devoloper because i love working and messing around with all types of
                electronics, computers, and software. Plus i have always had a passion for it and am intrigued how they
                work and imagining all the hard and different work that has to be done.</p>

            <p> If you have any questions or comments you can head over to the contact page and shoot me a message
                there, thanks!</p>
